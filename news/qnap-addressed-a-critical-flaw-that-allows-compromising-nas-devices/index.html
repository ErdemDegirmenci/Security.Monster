<p>Taiwanese vendor QNAP fixed a critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-28809, that could be exploited by attackers to compromise vulnerable NAS devices.</p>
<p>The vulnerability affects certain legacy versions of HBS 3 Hybrid Backup Sync, it was reported to the vendor by Ta-Lun Yen of TXOne IoT/ICS Security Research Labs.</p>
<p>“An improper access control vulnerability has been reported to affect certain legacy versions of HBS 3 (Hybrid Backup Sync). If exploited, this vulnerability allows attackers to compromise the security of the operating system.” states the security advisory published by the company.</p>
<p>The vendor addressed the flaw in the following versions of HBS 3:</p>
<p>QTS 4.3.6: HBS 3 v3.0.210507 and later

QNAP devices running QTS 4.5.x with HBS 3 v16.x are not affected.</p>

<p>“A ransomware campaign targeting QNAP NAS began the week of April 19th, 2021. The ransomware known as Qlocker exploits CVE-2021-28799 to attack QNAP NAS running certain versions of HBS 3 (Hybrid Backup Sync).” reads the security advisory published by the vendor.</p>
